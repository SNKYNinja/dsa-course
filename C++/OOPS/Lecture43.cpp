        Private v/s Protected : Access Modifier (NOT Mode of Inheritance)
        1. Both members with this access modifier are not accessible outside the class
        2. But protected members can be accessed by another inherited class

        Types:
        1. Single Inheritance
        2. Multi-level Inheritance
        3. Multiple Inheritance
        4. Hierarchical Inheritance
        5. Hybrid Inheritance
